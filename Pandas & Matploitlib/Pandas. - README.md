# What is Pandas?

Pandas is a python library for data manipulation and analysis. At its core, it lets us load large amounts of structured or semi structured data, clean it, transform it, and extract meaning from it fast. The 2 main data structures are **Series** (one dimensional) and **DataFrame** (table like, rows and columns).
