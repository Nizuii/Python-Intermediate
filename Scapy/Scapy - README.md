# What is Scapy?

- Think of scapy as a network packet manipulation tool. Scapy is not a network scanner, not a network sniffer, not an exploitation tool. Scapy lets us create a packet from scratch, modify any filed at any layer it also lets us send, recieve, sniff, replay packet. In simple words scapy lets us impersonate the network itself.
